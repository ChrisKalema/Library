    <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, 
      like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. 
      I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, 
      which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. 
      <span class = 'tooltip' data-message = "I'm a tooltip- stopped at 7:22!">am so happy,</span> my dear friend, 
      so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, 
      that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke 
      at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>
